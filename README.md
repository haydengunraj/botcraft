# BotCraft
BotCraft is a Kik bot which retrieves Minecraft crafting recipes based on user input. Although I haven't played the game in years, I do remember what a hassle it was to constantly look up crafting recipes. To try out the bot, add "BotCraft" on Kik.

The bot runs on the Flask framework and is hosted on OpenShift (https://www.openshift.com/). All crafting images are Â© Mojang and used in accordance with their Terms of Service (https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula).
