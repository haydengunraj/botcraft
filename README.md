# BotCraft
BotCraft is a Kik bot which retrieves Minecraft crafting recipes based on user input. Although I haven't played the game in years, I do remember what a hassle it was to constantly look up crafting recipes. To try out the bot, add "BotCraft" on Kik. If you notice a problem with the bot's performance, please send me an email via the address on my GitHub page.

The bot runs on the Flask framework and is hosted on OpenShift (https://www.openshift.com/). All crafting images are Â© Mojang and used in accordance with their Terms of Service (https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula).
